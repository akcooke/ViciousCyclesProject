<h1>Product Design and Quality</h1>
<p>
    When it comes to industry leading innovations in cycles and accessories, 
    Vicious Cycle products are what you have been waiting for. 
    e sell top quality cycling equipment and have been doing it for years. 
    Our products have become the supply line of choice and lesser 
    companies have been copying us for some time. Don't be fooled by imitators, 
    Vicious Cycles is the real deal. Don't settle for second best when it comes to your
     cycling needs, but don't feel you have to raid your savings. Vicious Cycle Products 
     is a name you can put your trust into, at a price you can afford. Of course, 
     Custom Work is another thing entirely. At Vicious Cycles, we are not interested 
     in a "Race to the Bottom" when it comes to creating custom builds.
      If you're interested in discussing a fully-custom or customized build, 
      come down to our store and visit with us to find out what we can really do.</p></article>

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Vicious Cycles Inc is a Angier based cycle workshop founded by a few 
    like-minded individuals in late 2010. Our mechanics build the 
    bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends 
    to the day to day operations. We hope to create and foster a strong 
    passion for the local biking scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast.</p>
    <p>We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. 
        We believe in the significance of individualism. 
        We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. 
        No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.</p>
     <p>You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, 
         you overcome it all and you ride again. It’s a Vicious Cycle! So make 
         it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle, 
         chase your dreams, live your life.
        </p>
<h2>Customer Service and Satisfaction</h2>
<p>At Vicious Cycles, we are committed to providing superior customer 
    service and satisfaction. Our staff will assist you every step 
    of the way, from product selection and ordering to truly custom builds. 
    We’ve been doing this whole custom thing for quite a while, and we've 
    seen some ups and downs, we're loving every moment of it. A proper 
    custom build takes time, and we’ll work closely with you to get it right. 
    From stylish cycles to trusty monster rides, we’ve done them all. 
    Talk with a member of our mechanics team to discuss your plan, and we'll 
    see your dream realized. </p>
<h2>How Can I Buy From Vicious Cycles? </h2>
 <p>Vicious Cycle products can be purchased/ordered at our store. 
     Come down today and we'll get started with a purchase of an 
     existing bike with cash, credit, or an in-house loan approval. </p>
     <p>All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before 
         projects will begin, and either payment in full, or an approved 
         in-house loan or a transfer of funds to a third-party vendor. 
         All purchases on custom cycles are final.</p>
<h2>Trade Shows</h2>
<p>We exhibit at several trade shows every year.  
    We are at home in the indoor showroom, but we believe the real 
    showroom can only be found out on and off the road. Cycling is a lifestyle- Live Your Life </p>
